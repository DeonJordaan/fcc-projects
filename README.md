# [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Projects
Project folders for the projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) Certification.
These are all built using vanilla flavours of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Portfolio
This was an initial build of the required project. It morphed into my current personal portfolio page in [this repo](https://github.com/DeonJordaan/my_portfolio) and can be seen in all it's glory at www.deon.dev.
### Product Page
For this project, I used the opportunity to build a landing page for my non-tech side-project, [Articulate Furniture](https://www.articulatefurniture.com/).
### Tribute Page
A tribute page dedicated to my favourite Formula 1 driver, [Ayrton Senna](https://www.ayrtonsenna.com.br/).
### Survey Form
A basic survey form that is designed to gather feedback on why cyclists cycle.
### Techical Documentation Page
A documentation page based on extracts from the JavaScript documentation.
