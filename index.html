				While statistics give important context, they cannot give a complete picture of a
				driver's achievements. Few accolades command more respect, than those handed down by
				one's peers. In a 2009
				<a target="_blank" href="http://f1greatestdrivers.autosport.com/how/">pole</a> of
				all 217 living Formula One racing drivers, Senna was voted the greatest driver ever.
				<br />
				Here are the moments that defined his rise to greatness.

			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1984</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">Proving his prowess</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					In the first five races of his debut season, Senna had not particularly grabbed
					everyone’s attention. But in a sodden Monte Carlo that all changed. Driving an
					uncompetitive Toleman, he clawed his way through the field from 13th on the
					grid, showing his prowess in the wet. He scythed past greats of the sport,
					closing on Alain Prost, only for the race to be stopped and to finish second.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1985</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">Lapping the field</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					A year on Senna had moved to Lotus. It was not the fastest car that year, but he
					still won seven pole positions. The Brazilian’s first win with the team came in
					his second race, and it was once again in the wet. He qualified on pole and beat
					the entire field apart from second place by an entire lap.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1987</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">Half a minute ahead</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					Senna had a particular association and affinity for Monaco. He won there on six
					occasions in his 10 years in the sport. The first of those wins came in 1987, in
					his final year with Lotus. Senna won by more than half a minute, but had to
					settle for third in the championship before his move to McLaren.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1988</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">Instinctive driving</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					“Suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously,” Senna
					said after his Monaco pole position in 1988. “I was driving it by a kind of
					instinct, only I was in a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel.”
					He outqualified his teammate, the great Alain Prost, by a frankly ridiculous
					1.427 seconds.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1988</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">The Rainman</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					Senna had defined himself against Prost, his teammate at McLaren, and overcame
					the Frenchman in their first season together. The Japanese Grand Prix was where
					he won the title for the first time. At Suzuka he stalled at the start, and fell
					way down the field. Then, drops of rain came, and he brilliantly carved his way
					through the pack, overtaking Prost for the lead which is where he stayed. It was
					the first of his three world championships.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1990</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">Breaking lap records</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					Qualifying at Jerez in 1990 was not in the easiest of circumstances. Martin
					Donnelly, driving for Team Lotus, had sustained an enormous and harrowing crash
					in Friday practice, which Senna was clearly moved by. That did not stop him
					putting his McLaren on pole ahead of the two Ferraris, breaking the lap record
					in the process.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1991</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">Winning at home</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					Senna cared deeply about Brazil. He draped himself in the flag when he won and
					donated millions to underprivileged children back in his homeland. So it was a
					source of deep anguish that he had not won in Brazil. That changed in 1991 when,
					in one of his most heroic races, he miraculously brought his McLaren home
					despite being stuck in sixth gear.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1992</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">Fighting at Monaco</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					The year 1992 was a significantly less prosperous for Senna. Nigel Mansell had
					won the first five races, thanks to his all-conquering Williams, and it seemed
					as if he would make it six in Monaco. However, an unexpected tyre change gave
					Senna the lead. On old rubber, he used all the defensive skills in his arsenal
					to keep the Briton behind in the closing laps and take another Monaco victory.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1993</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">His greatest race</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					Whenever a poll is held to ask which was Senna’s greatest race, his victory at
					Donington in 1993 always comes out on top. It was a simply stunning drive. He
					lost ground at the start, falling to fifth, before overtaking everyone in front
					to hold the lead by the end of the lap. In a wet race he mastered the conditions
					and strategy better than anyone else. Only Damon Hill finished on the same lap.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1993</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">His final podium</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					His final race for McLaren, and his final race win in Formula One. Senna took
					the only pole position of the year won by someone not driving a Williams. The
					Brazilian won the race from his great rival Alain Prost in the Frenchman’s final
					race. It was the last time either of them would finish on the podium.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="timeline__event">
				<h2 class="timeline__year">1994</h2>
				<h3 class="timeline__description">His final corner</h3>
				<p class="timeline__content">
					As he was leading the San Marino Grand Prix Senna crashed his car into a
					concrete barrier and sustained a devastating head injury. He was declared dead
					in hospital at 6:37pm that evening. Roland Ratzenberger had died the previous
					day when his car crashed during qualification. His and Senna's accidents were
					the first fatal accidents to occur during a Formula One race meeting in twelve
					years and they marked a turning point in the safety of F1.
